`benchmark.sh` file is a benchmarking utility.

It is a plain bash script. See `benchmark.sh -h` for a list of available options.

If you want to test your own patches simply add them to PATCHES array in `benchmark.sh`.
The `patches` directory contains several patches we already use for testing.

When run from root user this utility will flush memory caches before running every test.

Patches with the name ${number}_bits.patch (like 521_bits.patch) are used for switching
bit length. You shouldn't change them.

The rest of the patches are made for a step-by-step testing of implemented features and
their names are self-describing. They were used some time ago and now are not needed.
Keep them for historical reasons.

The only patch is tested now is "wmnaf.patch" which should be generated manually
via command `diff -Nur gnutls/lib/ lib/ > benchmark/patches/wmnaf.patch` and includes
all features added and enabled.
