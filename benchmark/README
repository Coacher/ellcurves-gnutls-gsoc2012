`benchmark.sh` file is a benchmarking utility.

It is a plain bash script. See `benchmark.sh -h` for a list of available options.

If you want to test your own patches simply add them to PATCHES array in `benchmark.sh`.
The `patches` directory contains several patches we already use for testing.

When run from root user this utility will flush memory caches before running every test.
